# Todo app with auth

This is a todo app made using React and Firebase. For styling I have used Tailwind CSS and Headless UI.

This is a simple todo app in which user firstly have to signup and then they can access the dashboard where they can add todos. 

For editing todo I have added Modal which will have the previous data prefetched and they can make changes to it.

This app was a great learning experience for me.
